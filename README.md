ArcherVirus
===========

My implementation of the virus from the tv show Archer

Written in C# and requires the .NET framework.

Currently runs a non visible windows form that has a timer that fires every minute.
This timer routine creates a new form that displays the 'virus' from Archer.

The virus gif and sound are displayed for 13 seconds every minute.

The virus is not visible in Windows Task Manager under Applications but it is visible
under Processes as ArcherVirus. Kill this process to stop the virus.
